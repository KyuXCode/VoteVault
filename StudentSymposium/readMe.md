Julian Student Symposium: The symposium was really refreshing to view the project in a different light, as we were able to share our project in an outlet 
that people outside of CS could understand what we were trying to accomplish with our work. It also made it feel very real that our project was actually
completing something and coming together. I really enjoyed that students stopped by and actually listened to topics that they weren't informed on, and paraphrasing
it in a way for them to understand. It was also nice to see so many other projects, and learn about their experiences working in a group enviroment over an iterated set of time. 
Overall, the symposium was a great experience and I'm very glad to have atteneded and represent my team, VoteVault.
