## **Summary**

VSTOP is a government-funded program that tracks and assists the Secretary of State in administrating the election equipment inventory within the State of Indiana. Among the multiple facets of this organization is the Election Systems Inventory (VSTOP-ESI), the central database where election equipment details are stored and managed by county clerks and other election officials.


The database is a critical part of executing elections in Indiana; a detailed election equipment inventory is necessary for audits, annual certifications, and more that need to be completed before elections may take place. This project’s focus will be creating a robust user interface that can be developed, tested, and deployed easily by future developers, while also being easy to understand and navigate by end users. (It doesn’t hurt if it looks nice, too!)


The primary user-base is county clerks and other election deputies. This matters because they are generally older and have a less-than-forgiving view of technology, so any developed features should be intuitive and self-explanatory in nature.
